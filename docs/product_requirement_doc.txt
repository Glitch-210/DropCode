PRODUCT REQUIREMENT DOCUMENT (PRD)
Product Name: DropCode

1. Purpose & Vision
Problem Statement

Current browser-based file transfer tools (e.g., Wormhole) rely heavily on long links or QR codes for cross-device file sharing. This introduces friction when users want to quickly transfer files from a PC to a mobile device without scanning QR codes or handling long URLs.

Vision

Create a single-page, ultra-fast file-sharing web app that enables users to:

Upload files on one device

Receive a short, human-readable code

Enter that code on another device

Instantly download the file

The experience should be faster, simpler, and more human-friendly than existing solutions.

2. Goals & Success Metrics
Primary Goals

Reduce steps required for PC → mobile file transfer

Eliminate dependency on QR codes

Provide an intuitive, distraction-free UI

Enable instant usage without login or setup

Success Metrics (MVP)

Time from upload → download < 15 seconds

User can complete transfer with ≤ 2 actions per device

< 1% failed transfers

Works smoothly on mobile and desktop browsers

3. Target Users
Primary Users

Students

Developers

Office workers

Designers

Anyone frequently transferring files between devices

Use Cases

PC → phone (most common)

Phone → PC

Sharing files in classrooms or meetings

Temporary file sharing without permanent storage

4. Scope Definition
In Scope (MVP)

Single-page web application

File upload via drag & drop or file picker

Short code generation for each upload

File retrieval using short code

Automatic expiry of files

Download on any device/browser

Out of Scope (MVP)

5. Core Features & Requirements
5.1 File Upload

Users can upload a single file

Supported file types: All

Maximum file size (MVP): 200 MB (configurable)

Upload begins immediately after file selection

5.2 Code Generation (Key Feature)

System generates a short, human-readable code

Code formats (choose one for MVP):

Alphanumeric (e.g., F7K9Q)

Word-based (e.g., blue-moon)

Code must be:

Easy to read

Easy to type

Case-insensitive

Code is displayed prominently after upload

5.3 File Retrieval

User enters code on any device

System validates code

If valid:

File metadata is shown (name, size)

Download begins immediately or on tap

If invalid or expired:

Clear, friendly error message

5.4 Expiry & Cleanup

Default expiry time: 10 minutes

File automatically deleted after expiry

Code becomes invalid once file is deleted

Optional one-time download flag (post-MVP)

6. User Experience (UX) Requirements
6.1 General UX Principles

Zero learning curve

Minimal text

No tutorials

No sign-up or login

Clear visual hierarchy

Calm, human-friendly language

6.2 Upload Screen (Desktop)

Drag & drop zone centered

“Click to upload” fallback

After upload:

Code shown in large font

Copy button

Expiry timer visible

Optional QR (secondary)

6.3 Download Screen (Mobile-first)

Input field for code

Large “Get File” button

Auto-focus on input

Minimal distractions

8. Technical Requirements (High-Level)
Frontend

Single Page Application (SPA)

Responsive (mobile-first)

Works on modern browsers

No page reloads during flow

Backend

File upload handling

Temporary file storage

Code-to-file mapping

Expiry management

Secure download endpoint

9. Security Considerations

All traffic over HTTPS

Codes must be random and non-guessable

Files not publicly indexed

Automatic cleanup to prevent data leakage

No permanent storage of files

10. Performance Requirements

Upload initiation < 1 second

Code generation < 300ms

Download start < 1 second after code entry

App loads under 2 seconds on mobile data

11. Error Handling
Upload Errors

File too large

Network interruption

Server unavailable

Retrieval Errors

Invalid code

Expired file

File already downloaded (if one-time)

All errors must use simple, friendly language.

12. Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

Multi-file uploads

Folder sharing

Password-protected codes

File preview

Download analytics

PWA support

Nearby-device detection

Team / session-based sharing

13. Risks & Mitigations
Risk	Mitigation
Code collisions	Increase code space & randomness
Storage abuse	File size limits + expiry
Guessable codes	Strong random generation
Server cost	Strict auto cleanup
14. MVP Definition (Final)

The MVP is complete when:

A user can upload a file

Receive a short code

Enter the code on another device

Download the file

File auto-deletes after expiry

No extra features required.

15. Summary
