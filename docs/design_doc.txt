DROPcode — DESIGN DOCUMENT
(Neo-Brutalist UI/UX Edition)
1. Design Philosophy
Core Belief

Speed over polish. Clarity over comfort. Function over decoration.

DropCode’s neo-brutalist design should feel:

Loud but honest

Raw but intentional

Simple but confident

This is not “pretty UI”.
This is utility with attitude.

2. Why Neo-Brutalism for DropCode

Neo-brutalism aligns perfectly with DropCode’s core idea:

File transfer is functional, not emotional

Users want immediacy, not elegance

Codes should feel authoritative, not subtle

Neo-brutalism:

Makes the code unmissable

Reduces visual ambiguity

Creates memorability (important for brand recall)

Differentiates DropCode instantly from Wormhole-like tools

3. Design Principles (Non-Negotiable)

Everything looks intentional

No soft shadows, no glass, no gradients

UI elements look clickable

Text is bold, readable, unapologetic

Layout feels constructed, not fluid

Minimal animations, maximum clarity

If something feels “smooth” → it’s probably wrong.

4. Information Architecture
Single Page, State-Driven UI

No routes. No menus. No onboarding.

UI switches between states, not pages:

Idle (Upload)

Uploading

Code Generated

Download Entry

Downloading

Expired / Error

Each state occupies the entire viewport.

5. Layout System
Grid

Simple vertical stack

Center-aligned main action

Hard edges, strict spacing

Containers

Thick borders (2–4px)

Solid background blocks

No elevation or depth illusion

6. Visual Language
6.1 Color System

One dominant background color at a time

One accent color (used sparingly)

Black or near-black borders

White or near-white text for contrast

Examples (conceptual):

Background: off-white / pastel yellow / muted mint

Accent: electric blue / red / black

No gradients. Ever.

6.2 Typography

Primary Font

Bold grotesk or industrial sans-serif

Large sizes

Tight line height

Code Font

Monospace

Extra bold

Wide letter spacing

Visually dominant

Typography is the UI.

6.3 Shapes

Rectangles

Sharp corners

No pills

No circles (except icons if unavoidable)

7. Component Design
7.1 Upload State (Idle)

Layout

Full screen block

Huge bordered upload box

Text inside box (not below it)

Visual Treatment

Thick border

Loud background

Upload zone looks like a physical surface

Microcopy

“DROP FILE HERE”

“CLICK IF YOU MUST”

Tone is confident, slightly playful, never polite.

7.2 Uploading State

Behavior

Upload box transforms into progress container

Border stays constant

Interior content changes

Components

File name (bold)

Progress bar (solid fill, no animation easing)

Percentage number (large, readable)

No spinners.

7.3 Code Generated State (Hero Moment)

This is the most important screen.

Layout Priority

CODE (huge, center)

Instruction text

Expiry timer

Secondary actions

Design Rules

Code must dominate the screen

Thick border around code block

High contrast background

Copy button looks like a real button

Microcopy

“YOUR CODE”

“TYPE THIS ON YOUR OTHER DEVICE”

“EXPIRES IN 10:00”

QR code (if present) is:

Smaller

Lower contrast

Clearly secondary

7.4 Download Entry State (Mobile-First)

Layout

Full screen

Input field as a bold rectangle

CTA button directly below

Behavior

Auto-focus input

Keyboard optimized

Immediate validation feedback

Microcopy

“ENTER CODE”

“GET FILE”

No helper text unless error occurs.

7.5 Downloading State

Visuals

Progress bar with sharp edges

File name in bold

Size info secondary

Behavior

Download starts immediately

No intermediate confirmation screens

7.6 Error & Expiry States

Tone

Honest

Direct

Calm

Examples

“CODE EXPIRED”

“FILE NOT FOUND”

“ASK FOR A NEW CODE”

No illustrations. No emojis.
Text carries the message.

8. Motion & Interaction

Neo-brutalism uses minimal, purposeful motion.

Allowed:

State transitions (instant or near-instant)

Button press feedback

Progress fill

Not allowed:

Bouncy animations

Delays for aesthetics

Decorative motion

If motion doesn’t explain state → remove it.

9. Accessibility & Usability

Large fonts

High contrast

Clear hit areas

Keyboard usable

No reliance on color alone

Works without camera or permissions

Neo-brutalism must still be usable, not hostile.

10. Brand Personality (UI Voice)

DropCode speaks like:

A confident tool

Slightly blunt

Never apologetic

Never verbose

Examples:

❌ “Please upload your file”

✅ “DROP FILE”

❌ “Something went wrong”

✅ “UPLOAD FAILED”

11. Design Guardrails (What We Will NOT Do)

❌ Glassmorphism

❌ Gradients

❌ Soft shadows

❌ Rounded blobs

❌ Over-animation

❌ Cute illustrations

If it looks trendy → question it.

12. Design Success Criteria

The design succeeds if:

Users understand the app in 3 seconds

The code is readable from across the room

The UI feels faster than Wormhole

The product feels confident, not decorative

13. Summary

DropCode’s neo-brutalist design turns a simple utility into a bold, memorable product.

It doesn’t try to be friendly.
It tries to be clear.

And clarity wins.
